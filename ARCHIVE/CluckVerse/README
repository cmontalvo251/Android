=================GAME===========================================

Make an app with all the quests

Just have one die that way the items you use actually sways the victor 

Have the lower tier items be a bit more create your own adventure. 

Maybe have people level up? Like every 5 rounds upgrade items to plus up or if you win the round you can upgrade 
 
Cool down period for all items

Narrow it down to just humans alive or dead to avoid unnecessary questions about realism 

Winning the round needs some sort of incentive like being able to ask a yes or no question but also getting to ask a private yes/no question

First skill is a quality you possess 
Second skill is something that exists in general 
Third skill is anything both real or fake

Second tool is something big but not really common.
Third tool is anything both real or fake

Tonight we will be playing:
20 Quest Hens!

Welcome to the Cluckverse! A planet where mystic chickens reign and thrive. A land of plHENty and a commonly visited planet due to its beautiful landscape and delicious pizza. 

The HENperor is a well-respected leader and quite the networker, attracting VIP guests from across the universe and through time. 

Recently, Oprah was visiting the Cluckverse to film and interview the HENperor. But in the middle of the night, someone time/space traveled to Cluckverse and plucked Oprah from her sleep! Stealing off into the night with their captive.

The devastated HENperor has hired teams of adventurers (you guys) to investigate the abduction and find out who did this, in order to rescue Oprah.
