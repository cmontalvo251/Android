Collection of my own android apps

First I downloaded Android Studio on my computer
(I'm using this tutorial)
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project

The first time this booted up took forever

Creating a virtual object didn't work real well
cannot add library /home/carlos/Android/Sdk/emulator/qemu/linux-x86_64/lib64/vulkan/libvulkan.so: failed 
2022-05-18 22:58:43,145 [ 402644]  ERROR -       Emulator: Pixel 2 API 30 - Failed to create Vulkan instance.

But a physical object via wireless worked but not with a hard line.

The wireless method was fine because I can easily send my program over wifi and install it on there.
